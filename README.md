For this project, I am acting as the Chief Data Strategist for a ride sharing company.  The company's complete dataset records have been given through CSV files shown in this repository.  This activity has been provided by the Georgia Tech Data Science and Analytics Boot Camp.

#### -- Project Status: Completed
## Project Intro/Objective
The dataset contains historic rider and driver log data.  It has been categorized in details such as city, driver count, individual fares, and city type. 

### Partner

### Methods Used
* Pandas 
* Matplotlib

### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook

## Project Description
My objective is to create a bubble chart that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, I will create pie charts based on the following.

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type

The purpose of this bubble chart is to provide three observable trends in the dataset.  The bubble chart will include the Plot Titles, Axes Labels, Legend Labels, Wedge Percentages, and Wedge Labels.
